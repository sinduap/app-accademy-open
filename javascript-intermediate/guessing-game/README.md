# Guessing Game Project

It's time for our first non-spec guided project! There are many projects in the course, some of which will not have test cases for you to run. These types of projects will hold your hand less and force you to make design decisions. Instead of specs, you will be provided with text instructions and example snippets to guide you. In order to end up with a working project, you should analyze these instructions closely.

## The Objective

Our objective for this project is to build a simple game where the user has to guess a secret number that is chosen at random. Upon making a guess, the user will receive a hint indicating if their guess is too small or too large. Below is an example of how the final product will play. We've denoted the user's input with _asterisks_. All other text is produced by the computer:

```
Enter a max number: *20*
Enter a min number: *11*
I'm thinking of a number between 11 and 20...
Enter a guess: *15*
Too high.
Enter a guess: *11*
Too low.
Enter a guess: *13*
Too high.
Enter a guess: *12*
Correct!
YOU WON.
```

We'll be building this project in phases, with each phase bringing us closer to the final product shown above. It's important that you follow the phases closely and don't jump the gun by ignoring the instructions and attempting to create your own game quickly. For these guided projects, the journey is more important than the final destination. Without further ado, let's jump in!

## Phase I: Too High? Too Low? Who knows.

Begin by creating a folder called `guessing-game-project`. Open the folder in VSCode. Inside of that folder create a `guessing-game.js` file. This is the file where we will do all of the coding.

Begin by initializing a variable in the global scope named `secretNumber` to any positive integer. Later we will program this variable to be assigned at random, but for now we'll hard-code a value that we can test for quickly.

### checkGuess

Define a function named `checkGuess` that accepts a number as an argument. It should compare that argument against the global `secretNumber`. It should have the following behavior:

- when the argument is larger than `secretNumber`, it should print 'Too high.' and return `false`
- when the argument is smaller than `secretNumber`, it should print 'Too low.' and return `false`
- when the argument is equal to `secretNumber`, it should print 'Correct!' and return `true`

Let's take a moment to verify that our code is working as intended. Make a few test calls to `checkGuess` in the global scope. Be sure to use a range of numbers so we can verify that it behaves properly in all three scenarios. You'll want to `console.log` the return values of `checkGuess` since it should return booleans. Run your code with `node guessing-game.js`. When you are positive that your function is working, remove the test calls from your file.

### askGuess

Since we will be taking user input during gameplay, we'll need to do some standard setup for Node's `readline` module. Reference the [readline docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/readline.html) to create an interface for input and output that we will use. To stay organized, we recommend that you import the module and create the interface at the tippy top of your file.

Define a function named `askGuess`. The method should use the `readline` module's `question` method to ask the user to 'Enter a guess: '. If you need a refresher on how to use this method, check out the [question docs](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_rl_question_query_callback). Once the user enters their number, the `checkGuess` function should be called with their number as an argument and the interface should be [closed](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_rl_close).

When accepting user input, there is a very important nuance to take into account. When the user enters their guess it will be interpreted as a string of numeric characters and not an actual number type! Depending on how you wrote your `checkGuess` function, this could be disastrous because:

```js
console.log(42 === '42'); // false
```

To overcome this issue, we should explicitly turn their guess into a number before we pass it into `checkGuess`. You can do this by calling the `Number` function. Here's an example of `Number` in action:

```js
let str = '42';
console.log(42 === Number(str)); // true
```

Test your `askGuess` by calling it once in the global scope. Then run your program a few times, entering different numbers. After trying a single guess, you will have to run the program again. Be sure to include an attempt with a correct guess by entering the `secretNumber` value that you hard-coded.

Once you have verified that the user's guess is being properly checked, let's work on having the function ask the user for another guess if they are incorrect. Refactor the `askGuess` method with some conditional logic. Recall that the `checkGuess` function returns a boolean - very convenient! Here is how the `askGuess` function should flow:

- check the user's guess
  - if it is correct, print out 'You win!' and close the interface
  - if it is incorrect, call `askGuess` again

You may find it a bit startling that you can reference the `askGuess` function from within the `askGuess` function. That is, you can a reference a function from within itself! This self-referential mechanism is leveraged quite frequently in programming. We will return to this concept in later lessons.

Run your program and test it out, being sure that you have a single call to `askGuess` in the global scope so the game can begin. Woohoo! We now have our minimal viable product (MVP) version of the game.

**Before moving onto the next phase, ask a TA for a code review.**

## Phase II: Making it Random

Now that we have the core gameplay down, we'll want to implement logic to allow the `secretNumber` to be chosen at random. To do this, we'll utilize the `Math#random` method. Take a look at the [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random). The method returns a decimal number between 0 and 1 (excluding 1). For example:

```js
console.log(Math.random()); // 0.5719957072947224
console.log(Math.random()); // 0.08590173924968769
console.log(Math.random()); // 0.0965770175443883
```

By itself, this method won't be too useful because our game should only use whole numbers. Luckily, the docs provide some insight into how we can design a function that returns a random whole number that lies within a certain range. Scroll through the docs and locate examples about "Getting a random integer between two values." You'll use these examples to inspire your code. You may notice that the examples provided rely on other methods like `Math.floor`. Research those methods so that you understand how the code works. Googling around and researching the docs is an important aspect of being a developer, so take your time!

### randomInRange

Define a function called `randomInRange` that accepts a minimum and maximum number as arguments. The function should return a random whole number between the provided minimum and maximum (inclusive). Be sure to test your function, here is an example of how it might behave:

```js
console.log(randomInRange(15, 20)); // 16
console.log(randomInRange(15, 20)); // 17
console.log(randomInRange(15, 20)); // 20
```

Once you have confirmed that your `randomInRange` function is returning numbers properly, edit your initialization of `secretNumber`. Instead of setting it to a hard-coded value, use your function's return value to set it to a random number between 0 and 100. Play a few games! Remember that you'll have to call `askGuess()` once in the global scope to begin the game. Next up, we'll allow the user to choose the min and max for the game.

### askRange

Delete or comment out your global call to `askGuess` for now. Define a function called `askRange`. This method should ask the user to enter a minimum number and then ask them to enter a maximum number. We want to ask them for the maximum only after they have responded to the first question. This means you will have to use the `question` method twice! Recall what you learned from the readings. The `question` method is asynchronous, so how can we ask two questions one after the other? We'll leave the implementation to you. After the user enters their min and max, you should print a message confirming the range. Here is an example of how our `askRange` method behaves. We've put asterisks around the user's input:

```
Enter a max number: *20*
Enter a min number: *11*
I'm thinking of a number between 11 and 20...
```

As always, test your function thoroughly by adding a call to `askRange` in global scope. Your program may hang because the interface is not closed after the user enters their max. That's okay, since we are debugging; press `ctrl + c` in your terminal to kill the program.

Once your function is able to properly take the min and max from your user, it's time to put it all together! When the user enters both the min and the max, call your `randomInRange` function with that min and max as arguments. Recall that the user's input is automatically interpreted as strings and not numbers. You should explicitly turn the min and max to actual numbers before passing them in. Take the random number returned from your function and set that as the `secretNumber`. Then call your old `askGuess` method so that gameplay can begin. All of this should happen within the `askRange` function. We design it this way because we only want to ask for a guess after the random number has been chosen.

The `askRange` function is the "main" function that will begin our game, so you'll need call it once in the global scope. Run your program and play a few games!

**Before moving onto the bonus ask a TA for a code review.**

## Bonus: Limiting the number of turns

With our main features complete, let's work on increasing the difficulty of the game by limiting the number of guesses a user can make. If the player uses all of their attempts without guessing the correct number, they will lose the game.

## Limiting turns to 5

Start by limiting the player to 5 attempts. You can accomplish this by initializing a `numAttempts` variable in the global scope. Refactor your `askGuess` method to decrement the number of remaining attempts whenever it is called. If the `numAttempts` reaches 0 before the correct guess is made, end the game by printing 'You Lose'. We'll leave the details of the implementation up to you.

## Limiting turns dynamically

Make the limit dynamic by allowing the user to specify the number of attempts. We recommend creating an `askLimit` function that behaves similarly to `askRange`. Be sure to chain the callbacks in the right order to ensure the game is configured properly. For example, one valid callback chain order would be `askLimit` -> `askRange` -> `askGuess`. If you follow this order, you'll need to call `askLimit` in the global scope to begin the game.
